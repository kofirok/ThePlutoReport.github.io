        <h3>Hunter x Hunter is technically not "new" but I put it on this list because
          it is one of my personal favorite animes that still is relevant today. Most people, including myself
          gravitated towards the characters in the show and their attitude, abilities and storylines. A great anime
          to watch if you havent already. Check out the trailer of this anime below.

        <h3>One Piece is another one of my favorite animes and probably the first anime I've seen since it is
        so old. It began in 1999, and is still going with over 900 episodes. Growing up watching this anime,
      and going to school and talking about it with friends used to be so fun. Great anime to watch if you have time
    and want to engage in a unforgettable story. Check out the trailer of this anime below. </h3>
